3.97 pairwise transient key (PTK): A value that is derived from the pairwise master key (PMK), Authenticator
address (AA), Supplicant address (SPA), Anthenticator nonce (ANonce), and Supplicant nonce
(SNonce) using the pseudo-random function (PRF) and that is split up into as many as five keys, i.e., temporal
encryption key, two temporal message integrity code (MIC) keys, EAPOL-Key encryption key (KEK),
EAPOL-Key confirmation key (KCK).

8.5.1.2 Pairwise key hierarchy

PRF- X(PMK, “Pairwise key expansion”,
Min(AA,SPA) || Max(AA,SPA) ||
Min(ANonce,SNonce) ||
Max(ANonce,SNonce))

Here, the following assumptions apply:
— SNonce is a random or pseudo-random value contributed by the Supplicant; its value is taken when
a PTK is instantiated and is sent to the PTK Authenticator.
— ANonce is a random or pseudo-random value contributed by the Authenticator.
— The PTK shall be derived from the PMK by
PTK ? PRF-X(PMK, “Pairwise key expansion”, Min(AA,SPA) || Max(AA,SPA) ||
Min(ANonce,SNonce) || Max(ANonce,SNonce))
TKIP uses X = 512 and CCMP uses X = 384. The Min and Max operations for IEEE 802 addresses
are with the address converted to a positive integer treating the first transmitted octet as the most significant
octet of the integer. The Min and Max operations for nonces are with the nonces treated as
positive integers converted as specified in 7.1.1.
NOTE—The Authenticator and Supplicant normally derive a PTK only once per association. A Supplicant or
an Authenticator may use the 4-Way Handshake to derive a new PTK. Both the Authenticator and Supplicant
create a new nonce value for each 4-Way Handshake instance.
— The KCK shall be computed as the first 128 bits (bits 0–127) of the PTK:
KCK ? L(PTK, 0, 128)
The KCK is used by IEEE 802.1X to provided data origin authenticity in the 4-Way Handshake and
Group Key Handshake messages.
— The KEK shall be computed as bits 128–255 of the PTK:
KEK ? L(PTK, 128, 128)
The KEK is used by the EAPOL-Key frames to provide confidentiality in the 4-Way Handshake and
Group Key Handshake messages.
— The temporal key (TK) shall be computed as bits 256–383 (for CCMP) or bits 256–511 (for TKIP)
of the PTK:
TK ? L(PTK, 256, 128) or
TK ? L(PTK, 256, 256)
The EAPOL-Key state machines (see 8.5.6 and 8.5.7) use the MLME-SETKEYS.request primitive to configure
the temporal key into the STA. The STA uses the temporal key with the pairwise cipher suite; interpretation
of this value is cipher-suite-specific.
A PMK identifier is defined as
PMKID = HMAC-SHA1-128(PMK, "PMK Name" || AA || SPA)
Here, HMAC-SHA1-128 is the first 128 bits of the HMAC-SHA1 of its argument list.
